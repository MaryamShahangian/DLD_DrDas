## Project Objectives

- **Simulate** the complete operation of a fuel pump system  
- **Calculate** the exact amount of fuel required based on user input  
- **Compute** the total cost dynamically as fuel dispenses  
- **Visually increment** a digital display to reflect fuel volume and price  
- **Implement** the design on a Xilinx FPGA platform  
- **Handle** edge cases (e.g. insufficient funds, maximum pump capacity)  
- **Provide** a clear, user-friendly interface for interaction
