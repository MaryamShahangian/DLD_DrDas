# Overall Project Objectives

- **Simulate** the complete operation of a fuel pump system  
- **Calculate** the exact amount of fuel required based on user input  
- **Compute** the total cost dynamically as fuel dispenses  
- **Visually increment** a digital display to reflect fuel volume and price  
- **Implement** the design on a Xilinx FPGA platform
